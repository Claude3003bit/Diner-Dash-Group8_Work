# Diner-Dash-Group8_Work
In this project, we student of ICT University made a python version of the Game Diner Dash. We analysed and divided the whole game into scenes and also provided a complete version of the game.  
Due to the fact that the whole project was heavy with pictures and sounds, we removed some of them. Then feel free to customise it as you want
